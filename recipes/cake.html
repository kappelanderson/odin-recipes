    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre heat your oven to 350 degrees F and line the bottom of 2 8 inch cake pans with parchment paper, spraying the sides with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk all the ingredients up to the milk.
        </li>
        <li>Add all the remaining ingredients, except the water, and whisk just a little bit until it just starts to mix together but is not fully mixed.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the hot water over and whisk until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Divide between the 2 pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 38-42 minutes. Let cool in the pan completely.
        </li>
        <li>While the cake is cooling, beat the butter and Greek yogurt in a large bowl until fluffy.
        </li>
        <li>Gradually add in then powdered sugar and cocoa powder and beat until mixed.
        </li>
        <li>Beat in the vanilla and salt.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate to firm up while the cake cools.
        </li>
        <li>Once the cake is cool, place one of the cake layers on a cake stand, bottom side up and spread 3/4 cup of the frosting on top.</li>
        <li>Place the other cake on top. Spread a VERY thin layer of frosting over the cake to seal in the crumbs, then chill 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Once chilled, frost the rest of the cake</li>
        <li>DEVOUR</li>
